# Sound2Image

## About the project

A few years ago, I (Gaël, 21, French) did some research at school about audio compression, and discovered what would become one of my favorite domain to study. We had some projects to lead, and I thought about mixing my love for music and images — I'm both a musician and photographer (amateurish) — by developing some program allowing to create an image from a song. My teachers said it would take more than the time I was allowed to work on this project, so here I am, doing this, without having any pressure, just for fun. This will also serve as a way for me to learn more about coding, using Git and stuff.

The name of this project is 113% temporary, as I didn't even think of a name after all that time (having never believed I would one day do something with this idea). Stuff like SongPainter or something definitely more poetic than Sound2Image will eventually come out one day !

Everything will be written in Python, as it's a language I've sort of learned at school and am currently using at work. Eventually, some other languages might come say hello.


## Ideas

This program / algorithm / whatever-it-will-be-in-its-eventual-final-stage will have to deal with some *raw data*, like numbers and stuff, how the audio signals are coded, as well as some more informative content : title, band name, album name, lyrics, duration, ...

I guess it won't be that easy to deal with so much stuff, but again, I'm here to learn and nobody is actually reading this ! :)


## Potential features

The following paragraphs summarize the several functionalities I'd like to code, and may or may not be part of the Sound2Image thingy I've set as an objective.
The idea is to get a substantial amount of data, numbers, parameters, ... in order to be able to generate an image from that.

### Surface analysis

##### Audio acquisition

A simple algorithm that reads the audio, and retrieve all sorts of numeric data, with the help of some mathematical functions and signal processing stuff (Fourier, Wavelets...) perhaps.

### In-depth analysis

##### Meta-data analyzer

Doing something about the song title, the album title, the band name, the duration of the song, and maybe other pieces of information might be great.

##### Lyrics analyzer

An algorithm which gets the lyrics, analyzes the words and sentences, and can tell whether the mood of the song is more joyful or Radioheadish.

##### BPM detector

An algorithm that tries to count the BPM of the song (only one if there is only one and sequences the song if not).

##### Tone detector

Trying to get the general (or the main ones) tone(s) of the song. Maybe finding chords progression or something (might go too far yes).

##### Instruments detector

Might go reaaaaally too far as well. Detecting the kind of instruments that are used, or at least recognizing the *genre* of the song, (ie. "Rock" if guitars with saturation are used, etc...).
